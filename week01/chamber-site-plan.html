      <p>How did these five animals - the lion, elephant, buffalo, rhinoceros and leopard - come to be called the Big Five?

        It was originally a hunting term used by the so-called great white hunters in the hunting heyday of the 19th and early 20thcenturies, when professional hunters bagged as many trophies as possible in as short a time as possible.
        
        Considered a rite of passage for seasoned travellers, everybody from American presidents to European royalty and heads of state came to Africa to shoot a large, dangerous animal.
        
        The Big Five quickly became known as the most dangerous animals to hunt on foot, and the name stuck - although now "shooting" is done through a camera lens.</p>
      <p>
        The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.
        <br>
        <br>
        The leopard (Panthera pardus) is one of the five extant species in the genus Panthera, a member of the cat family, Felidae. It occurs in a wide range in sub-Saharan Africa, in some parts of Western and Central Asia, Southern Russia, and on the Indian subcontinent to Southeast and East Asia. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because leopard populations are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and are declining in large parts of the global range. The leopard is considered locally extinct in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Jordan, Morocco, Togo, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Lebanon, Mauritania, Kuwait, Syria, Libya, Tunisia and most likely in North Korea, Gambia, Laos, Lesotho, Tajikistan, Vietnam and Israel. Contemporary records suggest that the leopard occurs in only 25% of its historical global range.
        <br>
        <br>
        African elephants (Loxodonta) are a genus comprising two living elephant species, the African bush elephant (L. africana) and the smaller African forest elephant (L. cyclotis). Both are social herbivores with grey skin, but differ in the size and colour of their tusks and in the shape and size of their ears and skulls.
        <br>
        <br>
        The African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) is a large sub-Saharan African bovine. Syncerus caffer caffer, the Cape buffalo, is the typical subspecies, and the largest one, found in Southern and East Africa. S. c. nanus (the forest buffalo) is the smallest subspecies, common in forest areas of Central and West Africa, while S. c. brachyceros is in West Africa and S. c. aequinoctialis is in the savannas of East Africa. The adult African buffalo's horns are its characteristic feature: they have fused bases, forming a continuous bone shield across the top of the head referred to as a "boss". It is widely regarded as one of the most dangerous animals on the African continent, and according to some estimates it gores, tramples, and kills over 200 people every year.
        <br>
        <br>
        The black rhinoceros, black rhino or hook-lipped rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) is a species of rhinoceros, native to eastern and southern Africa including Angola, Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Although the species is referred to as black, its colours vary from brown to grey. It is the only extant species of the genus Diceros.

      <h3>Who's Who</h3>
      <p>
        The animal kingdom has innumerable organisms under its massive tree. And many organisms share the same features as other organisms. Sometimes, this leads to confusion between the different species.
        <br>
        <br>
        Nature experts and novices alike would be forgiven for confusing these two stocky, horned animals. While they might be similar in many ways, there are several distinct differences between black and white rhinos, including their appearance, habitats, and behaviour.
        Their physical appearance is probably the most striking similarity between these two members of the Rhinocerotidae family. However, they differ quite dramatically in size. Black rhino generally weigh between 900 - 1.350 kg, while the size of their counterpart is almost double at 1.800 - 2.500 kg. White rhino are  the second-largest land mammal after the elephant.
        Other than size, another noteworthy difference in appearance is their upper lip. The white rhino's name, in fact, has nothing to do with its colour. The name is derived from the Afrikaans word “weit”, which means wide, and refers to the animal's muzzle. Black rhinos, on the other hand, have more of a hooked lip.
        Another distinct difference between these two horned creatures is their face shape and size. Black rhino have a shorter head from forehead to mouth, but a more protruding and smaller head. White rhino have a longer, less defined forehead and a much longer skull. Black rhino also tend to carry their heads higher, while white rhino lower their heads closer to the ground making grazing easier.
        Black rhino also have smaller, rounder ears than white rhino, whose ears are more pointed and narrower at the top. The larger size of white rhinos' ears is an important evolutionary adaptation for them as they make up for their poor eyesight with a nose that's usually close to the ground. 
        Although the black and white rhino both have two horns, the size and shape differ. The horns of black rhino are closer in length to one another, while the front horn of white rhino is longer than the second. Horns of male and female black rhino differ in that males often have thicker horns and females have longer, thinner ones. 
        As mentioned above, black rhino have a hooked lip and white rhino are known as square-lipped rhinos. This is due to their different eating habits. Black rhino browse instead of graze, so their hooked lip helps them to grab leaves from trees. In comparison, white rhino graze on grass, walking with their square-lipped heads close to the ground. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Generally, cheetahs have a more slender build as they chase and kill their prey. Being the fastest land animal on earth, the cheetah needs to have a slender build to be streamlined and more efficient at running. A leopard, on the other hand, has a more muscular build. They ambush predators, meaning they stalk their prey and pounce on them when they are within attacking range.
        The tail of the cheetah is quite flat, and it acts as a rudder on an aeroplane. They help in cornering and changing directions at speeds of over 80 km/h. The Leopard's tail is more stocky and tubular. It acts like a counterweight and helps the animal climb trees and to drag their kill up a tree.
        The other obvious difference is in their coats. Cheetahs have clear black spots all over its body and a leopard has irregular, rose-shaped spots called rosettes on its body.
        Cheetahs have black, tear-like streaks that run from the corner of their eyes all the way down to their cheeks. These are theorized to help absorb blinding sunlight and reduce glare in the intense heat of Saharan Africa. These spots are completely absent on the leopard's face.
        Compared to Cheetahs, Leopards are very good tree climbers, as they can easily climb up with the help of their retractile claws while cheetahs cannot.

        As during the bygone hunting era the term "Big Five" still conjure up the romance and excitement of Africa's exotic destinations and experiences.
        Imagine watching the sun set over the horizon whilst you capture the moment of a pride of lions stalking their prey. Watching a buffalo strolling to a water hole with strength and size that makes it more likely to kill a human than any other mammal.
        The rhino, which is almost extinct, with its extraordinary horns and bad temper. And the leopard with its beauty and remarkable speed and skill to hunt.
        Many travelers regard a visit to South Africa as incomplete without having spotted, and perhaps photographed, the Big Five.
        The Big Five - legends of the wilderness which have become synonymous with Africa.
